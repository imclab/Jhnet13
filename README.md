The redesign of the website started in 2013. This new site is based (possibly
slightly regrettably) on web.py. After my previous experiment with a statically
generated site based on a search of my home directory, I got fed up of having to
perform a build and rsync for any changes I made. This new site allows the more
important aspects to be managed as simply as uploading files to /misc.

Though I don't expect that this site will be at all useable by anyone else, feel
free to laugh openly at the construction (and send me any hints if there are any
security oopsies).

Requirements
------------

The site requires the following (available via pip):

* mako
* web.py
* flup
