<p>This repository contains an informal library of figures created in various
ways and for various purposes which may be of use to others. These figures are
typically described in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ">TikZ</a>,
<a href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> or generated by Python (usually by
outputting machine generated SVG or TikZ source).</p>

<p>Though the figures are intended to be aesthetically pleasing, their descriptions
are often not. Please be aware of this if you are considering adapting a
figure!</p>

<p>You can clone the repository containing these figures <a
href="https://github.com/mossblaser/figures">over on GitHub</a>.</p>
